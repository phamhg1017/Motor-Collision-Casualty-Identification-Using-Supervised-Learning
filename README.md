# Motor-Collision-Casualty-Identification-Using-Supervised-Learning
Enhancing Motor Collision Casualty Identification through Driver's Characteristic-Based Supervised Learning

Traffic collisions significantly cause numerous injuries and fatalities in many developed countries. The lack of traffic data availability problem has affected problem-solving efforts' practical contributions for years. Therefore, Motor Vehicle Collision data provided by New York City Police Department can be utilised to predict the severity of these accident hotspots. 

This project findings highlight the potential of machine learning and lay the foundation for future endeavours focused on driver-centric accident severity prediction
